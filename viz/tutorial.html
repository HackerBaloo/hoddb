            <p>
            Reproducibility in the building science domain has long been
            hampered by a lack of general access to large, descriptive
            real-world datasets and open implementations of published analyses.
            Published papers rarely include code or data. The code that is made
            available mostly consists of brittle, hard-coded implementations
            that are specific to the simulation or building being analyzed.
            </p>

            <p>
            We are in the process of developing Mortar, a platform for
            conducting reproducible building science research. Mortar consists
            of a large live dataset of over 100 buildings spanning over 26,000
            data streams and over 10 billion data points, a descriptive
            ontology-based data model for each building (called "Brick"), and
            an API for accessing and manipulating the available data using
            queries against the data model. A goal of the project is to foster
            a self-sustaining research community that uses and contributes to
            the Mortar platform.
            </p>

	        <p>
                <b>This tutorial</b> will walk you through the process of building a portable building analytics application -- Rogue Zone Airflow Identification -- and
                executing it on several real buildings using the Mortar platform. This document is not a comprehensive introduction to Mortar and its capabilities, but the tutorial
                will link to external documentation and resources where you can learn more.

            <ul class="list">
                <li><b>Site</b>: a single facility; any building with its own street address</li>

            <h3 class="ui header">Exploring Brick Models Interactively</h3>

            <p>
            Recall that a Brick model describes the <i>elements</i> and <i>structure</i> of a building and its subsystems and shows the <i>relationships</i> between them.
            Here you will use the Interactive Brick Query Builder to explore relationships between common building assets like thermostats and rooms.
            </p>

            <p>
            Nodes represent Brick <i>classes</i>. Edges represent Brick <i>relationships</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Click on nodes to expand them to reveal their relationships to other nodes. The query builder automatically constructs a
            SPARQL query from the nodes you have selected (indicated by a green highlight). Later, you will copy queries from the interface into a Jupyter notebook.
            </p>

            <p>
            Navigate to the <a href="https://querybuilder.mortardata.org" target="_blank">Interactive Brick Query Builder</a> page and take a few minutes to explore.
            </p>

            <p>
            Try to find connections between pairs of Brick classes; this should mirror how these types of things are connected in a real building.
            Pick one class to start with (e.g. <code>Floor</code>) and, by clicking and exploring, find a path to the other class (e.g. <code>Room</code>).
            The edge labels will tell you how each of these classes is related.

            <h3 class="ui header">Aside: Understanding SPARQL Queries</h3>
            <p>
            The Brick queries you have been generating use a query language called SPARQL. SPARQL queries have two parts -- <code>SELECT</code> and <code>WHERE</code> -- which consist of <i>variables</i> and <i>terms</i>.
            </p>

                    <b>Variables</b>, identified by their <code>?</code> prefix (e.g. <code>?sensor</code>) represent nodes and edges that will be "filled in" by the query processor. The variables in our running example are <code>?tstat</code> and <code>?sensor</code>

                    Terms can be thought of as "patterns" matching parts of the graph representing the Brick model.

                    The following is one of three terms from our running example. It contains one variable.

            <h3 class="ui header">Retrieving Qualified Sites</h3>

            <p>
            In order for applications to be <i>portable</i>, they need to be able to discover the configuration of a building
            and what data is available. This allows an application to configure itself to execute against many different buildings.
            Mortar applications use Brick queries to achieve this.
            </p>

            <p>
            It is often useful to see how many sites will return results for a given Brick query; this can also be used to estimate how portable an application is.
            Mortar provides a <code>Qualify</code> API method that returns the list of sites that return results for each provided Brick query.This is useful for

            <h3 class="ui header">Rogue Zone "Airflow" Application: Qualify</h3>

            <p>
            "Rogue Zone Detection" is a common, simple fault-detection application that involves finding zones in a building whose temperature is consistently above or below the setpoint, or whose airflow is consistently below the setpoint (underventilated). This application also has the distinction of being the first application we will build together using Mortar!
            </p>

            <p>
            We will construct the application according to the four phases above.
            We will start with <i>qualifying</i> which sites are able to run our application. This requires us to author one or more Brick queries that capture the assets our application needs and the relationships between them. Using the <a href="https://querybuilder.mortardata.org" target="_blank">Interactive Brick Query Builder</a>, create a Brick query that relates a <code>VAV</code> to a <code>Supply Air Flow Sensor</code> and <code>Supply Air Flow Setpoint</code>.
            When you want to test if your query is correct, paste the query into the cell below and execute to see how many sites qualify (<i>you should see 3 or 4</i>).
            </p>

            <p>
            When you are done, augment the query with relationships to the <code>HVAC Zone</code> and <code>Room</code> that will be affected by a rogue zone.

            We will now use the generated Brick query to tell Mortar what timeseries data and metadata we want to download for the application.
            The Mortar API uses two structures for this purpose: Views and DataFrames.

                A <b>View</b> is a table of metadata defined by the execution of a Brick query against a set of sites.
                The columns of the table consist of the variables in the <code>SELECT</code> clause of the Brick query that defines
                the table. Mortar adds the name of the site as an additional column to the table.

            </div>

            <p>
                A <b>DataFrame</b> is a table of timeseries data. The temporal extent of a DataFrame is defined by a start and end time,
                an aggregation function, and a bucket size for the aggregation (e.g. "15 minute mean"). A DataFrame contains 1 or more
                streams of timeseries data identified by column; the name of the column is a unique identifier for the stream.
            </p>

            <p>
				Below, we define two DataFrames for each of the collections of timeseries data the application needs. We define two different
				DataFrames because we want to aggregate setpoints differently than sensors: for setpoints we use the maximum setpoint in the aggregation
                window in order to avoid interpolating, but for sensors we use the average sensor reading in the aggregation window.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each DataFrame has a <b>name</b>, an <b>aggregation function</b> (can be one of mean, min, max, count, sum or "raw" for no aggregation),
                <b>window</b> size (argument to the aggregation function), and a list of <b>timeseries</b>.
                The list of timeseries tells Mortar to pull data for each stream identified by the values of each <code>data var</code> in the specified View.
                In this example, the <code>?Air_Flow_Sensor</code> variable from our Brick query corresponds to a list of names of air flow sensors.

                Now, lets combine the View and DataFrame definitions into a complete Fetch request. The full Fetch request ties together the sites
                we retrieved from our <code>Qualify</code> call, the View we defined, the DataFrames we defined, and the range of time we want to retrieve data for.
                <b>Execute the cell below</b> to fetch data from the Mortar API (<b>Note: this may take up to a minute</b>)

            Because the Mortar testbed consists of data from real buildings, we need to perform some data cleaning to make sure our analysis behaves
            how we would expect. For our simple application, we will just remove sensor and setpoint values from our DataFrame that are either missing or 0.
            </p>

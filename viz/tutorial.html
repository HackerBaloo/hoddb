            <p>
            Reproducibility in the building science domain has long been
            hampered by a lack of general access to large, descriptive
            real-world datasets and open implementations of published analyses.
            Published papers rarely include code or data. The code that is made
            available mostly consists of brittle, hard-coded implementations
            that are specific to the simulation or building being analyzed.
            </p>

            <p>
            We are in the process of developing Mortar, a platform for
            conducting reproducible building science research. Mortar consists
            of a large live dataset of over 100 buildings spanning over 26,000
            data streams and over 10 billion data points, a descriptive
            ontology-based data model for each building (called "Brick"), and
            an API for accessing and manipulating the available data using
            queries against the data model. A goal of the project is to foster
            a self-sustaining research community that uses and contributes to
            the Mortar platform.

            <h3 class="ui header">Exploring Brick Models Interactively</h3>

            <p>
            Recall that a Brick model describes the <i>elements</i> and <i>structure</i> of a building and its subsystems and shows the <i>relationships</i> between them.
            Here you will use the Interactive Brick Query Builder to explore relationships between common building assets like thermostats and rooms.
            </p>

            <p>
            Nodes represent Brick <i>classes</i>. Edges represent Brick <i>relationships</i>.
            
            Click on nodes to expand them to reveal their relationships to other nodes. Change the starting class by clicking an item in the "Start From..." box. The query builder automatically constructs a
            SPARQL query from the nodes you have selected (indicated by a green highlight). Later, you will copy queries from the interface into a Jupyter notebook.
            </p>

            <p>
            Navigate to the <a href="https://hoddb.mortardata.org" target="_blank">Interactive Brick Query Builder</a> page and take a few minutes to explore. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Try to find connections between pairs of Brick classes; this should mirror how these types of things are connected in a real building.
            Pick one class to start with (e.g. <code>Floor</code>) and, by clicking and exploring, find a path to the other class (e.g. <code>Room</code>).
            The edge labels will tell you how each of these classes is related.

            <p>
            Mortar provides a <code>Qualify</code> API method that returns the
            list of sites matching a set of Brick queries. This is useful for
            estimating how portable your application is -- i.e. how many sites

        <div class="ui raised segment">
            <h3 class="ui header">Rogue Zone "Airflow" Application: Qualify</h3>

            <p>
            "Rogue Zone Detection" is a common, simple fault-detection application that involves finding zones in a building whose temperature is consistently above or below the setpoint, or whose airflow is consistently below the setpoint (underventilated). This application also has the distinction of being the first application we will build together using Mortar!
            </p>

            <p>
            We will construct the application according to the four phases above.
            We will start with <i>qualifying</i> which sites are able to run our application. This requires us to author one or more Brick queries that capture the assets our application needs and the relationships between them. Using the <a href="https://hoddb.mortardata.org" target="_blank">Interactive Brick Query Builder</a>, create a Brick query that relates a <code>VAV</code> to a <code>Air Flow Sensor</code> and <code>Air Flow Setpoint</code>.
            When you want to test if your query is correct, paste the query into the cell below and execute to see how many sites qualify.
            </p>

            <p>
            When you are done, augment the query with relationships to the <code>HVAC Zone</code> and <code>Room</code> that will be affected by a rogue zone.
            </p>

            <pre data-executable="true" data-language="python">

            <h3 class="ui header">Rogue Zone "Airflow" Application: Fetch</h3>

            <p>
            We will now use the generated Brick query to tell Mortar what timeseries data and metadata we want to download for the application.
            The Mortar API uses two structures for this purpose: Views and DataFrames.
            </p>

            <p>
            <i>For more detailed documentation, see the <a href="https://mortardata.org/docs/pymortar/">PyMortar documentation</a></i>.
            </p>

            <h4 class="ui header">View</h4>

            <p>
                A <b>View</b> is a table of metadata defined by the execution of a Brick query against a set of sites. 
                The columns of the table consist of the variables in the <code>SELECT</code> clause of the Brick query that defines
                the table. Mortar adds the name of the site as an additional column to the table.
            </p>

            <p>
            Below, complete the definition of the View for our application using the Brick query we defined in the <code>Qualify</code> step:
            </p>

            <pre data-executable="true" data-language="python">
rogue_view = pymortar.View(
    name="airflow",
    definition=rogue_zone_query,
)
print("Defined View")
            </pre>

            <div class="ui divider"></div>

            <h4 class="ui header">DataFrame</h4>
            <p>
                A <b>DataFrame</b> is a table of timeseries data. The temporal extent of a DataFrame is defined by a start and end time,
                an aggregation function, and a bucket size for the aggregation (e.g. "15 minute mean"). A DataFrame contains 1 or more
                streams of timeseries data identified by column; the name of the column is a unique identifier for the stream.
            </p>

            <p>
				Below, we define two DataFrames for each of the collections of timeseries data the application needs. We define two different
				DataFrames because we want to aggregate setpoints differently than sensors: for setpoints we use the maximum setpoint in the aggregation
                window in order to avoid interpolating, but for sensors we use the average sensor reading in the aggregation window.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each DataFrame has a <b>name</b>, an <b>aggregation function</b> (can be one of mean, min, max, count, sum or "raw" for no aggregation),
                <b>window</b> size (argument to the aggregation function), and a list of <b>timeseries</b>.
                The list of timeseries tells Mortar to pull data for each stream identified by the values of each <code>data var</code> in the specified View.
                In this example, the <code>?Air_Flow_Sensor</code> variable from our Brick query corresponds to a list of names of air flow sensors.
            </p>

            <p>
                The temporal parameters are specified in the next step.

            <p>
            You have now successfully built and executed a rogue zone application for airflow. You will now construct a similar application that analyzes temperature sensors and setpoints.
            Using the <a href="https://hoddb.mortardata.org" target="_blank">Interactive Brick Query Builder</a>, construct a Brick query that retrieves HVAC zones, their related thermostat, and
            the thermostat's temperature sensors and setpoints. Paste this query below
            </p>


            <pre data-executable="true" data-language="python">
